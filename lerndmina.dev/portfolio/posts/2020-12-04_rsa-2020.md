## Which brief did I choose and why?

I chose the home sweet home brief. It came with the question “How might we harness age friendly design to future-proof homes, so they are sustainable, safe and inclusive places to live and enjoy?”

This question inspired me to think about something that I had observed. Elderly people always seem to have their heating turned all the way up, or all the way down. If you visit the home of an elderly person, it is either so warm you are sweating buckets or so cold you think you need about three extra layers! The weirdest part about this whole phenomenon is they never seem to notice.

It turns out that some physical changes in elderly people mean that they often notice heat differently to their younger counterparts in the same environment. They may feel unnervingly comfortable at hotter temperatures and are strangely at ease when you can’t stop shivering. This can be a major problem in the summer months when the temperature can rise so much that elderly people can be put in danger of Hyperthermia

I want to stop this. Nobody should be in danger of death in their own home because they can’t sense when it’s getting too hot or too cold. To do this I’m going to design a climate control system to help the elderly in their homes. I want to use machine learning to predict when the occupant requires heat or cooling based on their previous behaviour. The system will also have safety limits to prevent elderly people from overheating or under heating themselves and would notify an emergency contact if safe parameters are exceeded.
